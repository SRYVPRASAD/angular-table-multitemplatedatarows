# angular-table-multitemplatedatarows

[Edit in Codeflow ⚡️](https://stackblitz.com/~/github.com/SRYVPRASAD/angular-table-multitemplatedatarows)


## How it Works
- This project demonstrates how to create a table with sorting functionality using Angular Material.
- The data source is implemented using **MatTableDataSource** and the sorting is controlled by **MatSort**.
- The **sortData** method in the component sorts the data based on the selected column and direction.
- The **compare** function is used to compare values in different columns for sorting.
  
## Usage
You can use this project as a starting point for adding sorting functionality to your own Angular Material table.

To add this sorting functionality to your existing project:

1. Copy the relevant components and HTML code.
2. Import the required Angular Material modules and components in your project.
3. Modify the **ELEMENT_DATA** and column definitions to match your data structure.
4. Customize the sorting logic in the **sortData** method as needed.
   
Feel free to explore the code and adapt it to your specific use case.
